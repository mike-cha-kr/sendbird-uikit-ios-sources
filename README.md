## Introduction

Sendbird UIKit for iOS is a development kit with an user interface that enables an easy and fast integration of standard chat features into new or existing client apps. This repository houses the UIKit source code in addition to a sample as explained below.

- **uikit** is the open source code. Check out [UIKit Open Source Guidelines](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-uikit-android-sources/blob/main/OPENSOURCE_GUIDELINES.md) for more information regarding our stance on open source. 
- **uikit-sample** is a chat app which contains custom sample codes for various key features written in `Swift`. 

### More about Sendbird UIKIT for iOS

Find out more about Sendbird UIKit for iOS at [UIKit for iOS doc](https://sendbird.com/docs/uikit/v1/ios/getting-started/about-uikit). If you need any help in resolving any issues or have questions, visit [our community](https://community.sendbird.com).

## Before getting started

This section shows you the prerequisites you need for testing Sendbird UIKit for iOS sample app. 

### Requirements

The minimum requirements for UIKit for iOS are:

- iOS 10.3 or later
- Swift 4.2 or later / Objective-C
- Chat SDK for iOS is 3.0.216 or later

> Note: Sendbird UIKit for iOS is Sendbird Chat SDK-dependent. If you install the UIKit, `CocoaPods` will automatically install the Chat SDK for iOS as well. 

### Try the sample app using your data 

If you would like to try the sample app specifically fit to your usage, you can do so by replacing the default sample app ID with yours, which you can obtain by [creating your Sendbird application from the dashboard](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/ios/getting-started/install-chat-sdk#2-step-1-create-a-sendbird-application-from-your-dashboard). Furthermore, you could also add data of your choice on the dashboard to test. This will allow you to experience the sample app with data from your Sendbird application.

## Getting started

This section explains the steps you need to take before testing the sample app.

### Create a project

Create a project to get started. Sendbird UIKit supports both `Objective-C` and `Swift`, so you can create and work on a project in the language you want to develop with.

### Install UIKit for iOS

The sample uses source files from `uikit` folder directly, but you can also install UIKit for iOS through either `CocoaPods` or `Carthage`.

#### - CocoaPods

1. Add `SendBirdUIKit` into your `Podfile` in Xcode as below:

```bash
platform :ios, '10.3' 
use_frameworks! 

target YOUR_PROJECT_TARGET do
    pod 'SendBirdUIKit'
end
```

2. Install the `SendBirdUIKit` framework through `CocoaPods`.

```bash
$ pod install
```

3. Update the `SendBirdUIKit` framework through `CocoaPods`.

```bash
$ pod update 
```

> __Note__: Sendbird UIKit for iOS is `Sendbird Chat SDK-dependent`. If you install the UIKit, `CocoaPods` will automatically install the Chat SDK for iOS as well. The minimum requirement of the Chat SDK for iOS is 3.0.216 or later. 

#### - Carthage

1.Add `SendBirdUIKit`and `SendBirdSDK`into your `Cartfile` as below:

> __Note__: Sendbird UIKit for iOS is `Sendbird Chat SDK-dependent`. The minimum requirement of the Chat SDK for iOS is 3.0.216 or later. 

```bash
github "sendbird/sendbird-uikit-ios"
github "sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework" == 3.0.216
```

2. Install the `SendBirdUIKit` framework through `Carthage`.

```bash
$ carthage update
```

3. Go to your Xcode project target’s **General settings** tab in the `Frameworks and Libraries` section. Then drag and drop on the disk each framework from the `<YOUR_XCODE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/Carthage/Build/iOS` folder.
4. Go to your Xcode project target’s **Build Phases settings** tab, click the **+** icon, and choose **New Run Script Phase**. Create a `Run Script`, specify your shell (ex: /bin/sh), and add `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks` to the script below the shell.
5. Add the following paths to the `SendBirdUIKit` and `SendBirdSDK` frameworks under `Input Files`.

```bash
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SendBirdUIKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SendBirdSDK.framework
```

> __Note__: Building or creating the `SendbirdUIKit` framework with `Carthage` can only be done using the latest `Swift`. If your `Swift` is not the most recent version, the framework should be copied into your project manually.

#### Handling errors caused by unknown attributes

If you are building with Xcode 11.3 or earlier version, you may face two following errors caused by Swift's new annotation processing applied on `Swift 5.2` which is used in Xcode 11.4.

```bash
- Unknown attribute ‘_inheritsConvenienceInitializers’
- Unknown attribute ‘_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers’
```

When these errors happen, follow the steps below which remove the annotations by executing the necessary script in the build steps in advance. 

1. Open the **Edit scheme** menu of the project target.
![EditScheme](https://static.sendbird.com/docs/uikit/ios/getting-started-handling-errors-01_20200623.png)
2. Go to **Build** > **Pre-actions** and select the **New Run Script Action** option at the bottom.
![NewRunScriptAction](https://static.sendbird.com/docs/uikit/ios/getting-started-handling-errors-02_20200623.png)
3. Add the script below. Select the target to apply the script.
![ApplyScript](https://static.sendbird.com/docs/uikit/ios/getting-started-handling-errors-03_20200623.png)

```bash
# CocoaPods
if [ -d "${PROJECT_DIR}/Pods/SendBirdUIKit" ]; then
    find ${PROJECT_DIR}/Pods/SendBirdUIKit/SendBirdUIKit.framework/Modules/SendBirdUIKit.swiftmodule/ -type f -name '*.swiftinterface' -exec sed -i '' s/'@_inheritsConvenienceInitializers '// {} +
    find ${PROJECT_DIR}/Pods/SendBirdUIKit/SendBirdUIKit.framework/Modules/SendBirdUIKit.swiftmodule/ -type f -name '*.swiftinterface' -exec sed -i '' s/'@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers '// {} +
fi

# Carthage
if [ -d "${PROJECT_DIR}/Carthage/Build/iOS/SendBirdUIKit.framework" ]; then
    find ${PROJECT_DIR}/Carthage/Build/iOS/SendBirdUIKit.framework/Modules/SendBirdUIKit.swiftmodule/ -type f -name '*.swiftinterface' -exec sed -i '' s/'@_inheritsConvenienceInitializers '// {} +
    find ${PROJECT_DIR}/Carthage/Build/iOS/SendBirdUIKit.framework/Modules/SendBirdUIKit.swiftmodule/ -type f -name '*.swiftinterface' -exec sed -i '' s/'@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers '// {} +
fi
```
4. Try to build and run
